# PyCAM
Dan Heeks's experimental CAD/CAM software built on Dan's PyCAD for the Raspberry Pi, not to be confused with the more famous PyCAM ( http://pycam.sourceforge.net/ ).
### see wiki for building instructions ###

### Heeks2 ###
If I get it all working, I'll be calling it Heeks2, but I don't plan to change the source code projects names

I have made an automatic build for Ubuntu 22.04.  
https://code.launchpad.net/~danheeks/+recipe/cam-daily  
To install for Ubuntu 22.04 type in a terminal:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danheeks/ppa
sudo apt-get install cam
```

you should then get a launch icon labelled HeeksCNC  
( screenshot from Ubuntu to follow... )
